       SIGNIFICANCE OF CHEMICAL ATOMS: <br> 
       Unveiling the building blocks of the Universe
       <br>
       <br>
     </p>
    <h3><br>
        Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter, forming the basis of everything in the universe.<br>
        Understanding atoms is crucial because they are the smallest units of chemical elements that retain the <br> 
        properties of those elements. Composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons, atoms combine in various <br> 
        ways to form molecules, which make up the substances and materials we encounter every day.<br>
        The study of atoms is essential for a wide range of scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, <br>
        biology, and material science. Atoms determine the structure, behavior, and interactions <br>
        of all substances,allowing scientists to explain why materials have certain properties, how chemical <br>
        reactions occur, and how life itself is sustained.
